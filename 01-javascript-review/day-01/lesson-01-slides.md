# Lesson Objectives

---

## By the end of this lesson, you should be able to

- Explain how JavaScript data flows through a program
- Use variables and functions to solve small problems
- Work with arrays and objects to represent application data
- Describe how JavaScript updates the DOM in response to events

# Agenda

---

## Today's plan

- Instructor led demo
- Short, incremental code steps
- Review updates after each change
- You code along, then extend
- Student exercise

The goal is understanding, not speed

# Lesson Purpose

---

## Why this lesson exists

- Students come in with uneven JavaScript backgrounds
- We need shared mental models before components and frameworks
- Strong fundamentals reduce friction and debugging later
- Today is about thinking clearly, not memorizing syntax

# JavaScript's Role

---

## What JavaScript actually does

- Stores and transforms data
- Makes decisions
- Responds to user actions
- Updates the DOM

Every front-end tool builds on these responsibilities.

# Variables and State

---

## Variables

- `const` for values that shouldn't change
- `let` for values that will change
- Names should communicate intent

If you can name it well, you probably understand it.

# Functions

---

## Functions as problem-solving units

- Encapsulate logic
- Accept inputs (parameters)
- Produce outputs (return values)

Small, predictable functions are easier to debug and reuse.

# Data Structures

---

## Arrays and objects

- Arrays represent collections
- Objects represent entities or concepts
- Real applications combine both constantly

Most bugs are really data-shape problems.

# Problem Solving

---

## Turning data into results

- Break problems into steps
- Loop deliberately
- Build results incrementally

Code is written reasoning.

# The DOM

---

## The DOM is not magic

- It's a tree structure
- JavaScript reads and modifies it
- UI changes reflect data changes

Understanding this removes a lot of confusion.

---

# Events

---

## Events drive interaction

- Clicks, input, keyboard events
- Events trigger functions
- Functions update data and UI

This event loop is the heart of front-end development.

# Mental Model

---

## How front-end code really works

1. Data exists
2. User interacts
3. JavaScript runs
4. UI updates

Repeat forever.

# Success Today

---

## What "good" looks like

- You can explain what your code is doing
- You can trace data through a function
- You can predict outcomes before running code

Speed doesn't matter. Understanding does.

# Hands-on practice

Exercise: Build a simple JavaScript refresher app
**Objective**: Demonstrate understanding of JavaScript basics.

- Obtain the exercise starter files
   - Complete the walkthrough with the instructor.
   - Address the student exercise prompts.
   - Ask questions if you are unsure of what to do or how the code works.
